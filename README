The key and secret are picked up from environment variables 
and so the virtual host must define them, for example in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ add a .conf file with:

<VirtualHost *:9000>                                                                                                                                          
  DocumentRoot /path/to/oauth-sample                                                                                                                     
  SetEnv OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY 'yourkey'                                                                                                        
  SetEnv OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET 'yoursecret'                                                                                                                   
</VirtualHost> 

And you will probably need to add to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
 Listen 9000

Restart apache

Then hit your server on port 9000
